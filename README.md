Kaggle digit recognition

Building model for automated digit recognition. Data downloaded from kaggle.com. 

1. Learning caret package, so I tried to use syntax for data partition/model training etc.
2. Features extracted from original data: symmetry/width&height ratio/etc. -- not the best method.
3. Random Forest with 2. features -- 75% accuracy
